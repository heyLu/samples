You may start the application by running the following commands:

To understand what's going on, have a look at [helloworld_app/app](./app/src/helloworld_app/app.cljs)
or run `lein marg` (with [lein-marginalia set up](https://github.com/fogus/lein-marginalia/#installation))
and look at `docs/uberdoc.html`.
